## Role Assignment

- Enabled: True
- Benchmark: workbench
- Used Fallback: False
- Fallback Reason: _None_
- LLM: model=deepseek-flash mock_used=False token_in=814 token_out=31

### Assigned Roles

- agent_0: Workflow Planner
  You analyze workplace tasks and decompose them into a sequence of tool operations across calendar, email, CRM, and project management systems. You identify which systems to query or update and in what order.
- agent_1: CRM Data Analyst
  You navigate customer relationship management data effectively. You can look up contacts, analyze customer interactions, track deal pipelines, and generate insights from CRM records.
- agent_2: Task Completion Verifier
  You verify that workplace tool operations have been executed correctly and completely. You check that all required actions were taken, data was properly updated across systems, and the final state matches the task requirements.

### Prompt

#### Prompt 1 [SYSTEM]

```text
You are a multi-agent system architect. Your task is to assign domain-specific roles to agents in a multi-agent topology. Structural workflow contracts remain authoritative; personas should specialize how each agent approaches its assigned stage, especially for tool use, evidence gathering, verification, and synthesis.
```

#### Prompt 2 [USER]

```text
Assign domain-specific roles to the agents in a **self_evolved** topology for the **workbench** benchmark.

## Topology Structure
- Topology type: self_evolved
- Number of agents: 3
- Agents (id, structural role, hierarchy level):
  - agent_0: structural_role=coordinator, level=0
  - agent_1: structural_role=worker, level=1
  - agent_2: structural_role=worker, level=1
- Communication links:
  - agent_0 -> agent_1, agent_2
  - agent_1 -> agent_0
  - agent_2 -> agent_0

## Task Preview
[{'role': 'system', 'content': "Today's date is Thursday, 2023-11-30 and the current time is 00:00:00. Remember the current date and time when answering queries. Meetings must not start before 9am or end after 6pm. Use the provided workplace tools to complete the task. After using tools, provide a brief natural-language confirmation."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Can you find the person with the fewest overdue tasks and assign Jamie Davis to them as a new lead in the crm?'}]

## Available Domain Roles
  1. **Workflow Planner** — You analyze workplace tasks and decompose them into a sequence of tool operations across calendar, email, CRM, and project management systems. You identify which systems to query or update and in what order.
  2. **Calendar Operations Specialist** — You are an expert at managing calendar operations: scheduling meetings, checking availability, resolving conflicts, handling recurring events, and managing timezone conversions. You ensure temporal constraints are satisfied.
  3. **Email and Communication Expert** — You handle email composition, retrieval, and analysis tasks. You understand email threading, can search for specific messages, draft appropriate responses, and extract actionable information from email content.
  4. **CRM Data Analyst** — You navigate customer relationship management data effectively. You can look up contacts, analyze customer interactions, track deal pipelines, and generate insights from CRM records.
  5. **Cross-System Integrator** — You specialize in tasks that span multiple workplace systems. You correlate data across calendar, email, CRM, and project management tools, ensuring consistency and completeness when operations affect multiple systems.
  6. **Task Completion Verifier** — You verify that workplace tool operations have been executed correctly and completely. You check that all required actions were taken, data was properly updated across systems, and the final state matches the task requirements.

## Instructions
Assign exactly one domain role to each agent. Consider:
1. The agent's structural position — orchestrators / root nodes benefit from coordinator or planner roles; leaf workers benefit from specialist or executor roles.
2. The specific task requirements — which expertise areas are most needed for this task.
2a. The likely tool workflow — retrieval-heavy tasks should map querying, evidence-reading, verification, and synthesis roles to different agents when the topology supports specialization.
3. Diversity — avoid assigning the same role to all agents unless the topology requires uniform roles (e.g. voting).
4. For hierarchical topologies: higher-level agents should have broader, coordinating roles; lower-level agents should have focused, execution-oriented roles.
5. You may assign the same role to multiple agents if the topology has more agents than available roles.

Return a JSON object mapping each agent_id to a role name from the pool above. Example:
{"agent_0": "Role Name A", "agent_1": "Role Name B"}

Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
```

### Response

```text

## Prompt Catalog

### p_1 [SYSTEM] x1
You are one agent in a deterministic multi-agent workflow.
Agent ID: agent_0
Agent Role: coordinator
Stage Role: planner
Instruction priority: 1) structural stage contract, 2) tool-use contract, 3) task and benchmark instructions, 4) domain persona.
Domain Role: Workflow Planner
Persona: You analyze workplace tasks and decompose them into a sequence of tool operations across calendar, email, CRM, and project management systems. You identify which systems to query or update and in what order.

Use only the task messages, the prior artifact, and the visible packets provided in this conversation. Do not invent hidden context.
Return exactly one JSON object and do not wrap it in markdown.
Required JSON keys: answer_artifact, summary, critique, revision_request, confidence, unresolved_issues, evidence_summary.
Set confidence to reflect confidence in the current answer_artifact only, using this rubric: 0.0 = no answer or pure planning; 0.25 = weak hypothesis; 0.5 = plausible but incomplete; 0.75 = likely correct with remaining gaps; 1.0 = strongly supported final answer. If a field is unknown, use an empty string, an empty list, or a conservative confidence score.
evidence_summary must summarize actual evidence from tool outputs, visible packets, or the prior artifact. Do not claim evidence that was not actually retrieved or provided.
Planner contract: answer_artifact should contain a bounded work plan or task package. Do not present a speculative final answer as completed work.
Available tools:
- project_management.get_task_information_by_id(task_id:string, field:string): Returns task information for a given ID.
- project_management.search_tasks(task_name:string, assigned_to_email:string, list_name:string): Searches tasks by task metadata.
- customer_relationship_manager.search_customers(customer_name:string, customer_email:string, product_interest:string): Searches customer records by multiple filters.
- company_directory.find_email_address(name:string): Finds the email address of an employee by name.

### p_7 [SYSTEM] x1
You are one agent in a deterministic multi-agent workflow.
Agent ID: agent_2
Agent Role: worker
Stage Role: critic
Instruction priority: 1) structural stage contract, 2) tool-use contract, 3) task and benchmark instructions, 4) domain persona.
Domain Role: Task Completion Verifier
Persona: You verify that workplace tool operations have been executed correctly and completely. You check that all required actions were taken, data was properly updated across systems, and the final state matches the task requirements.

Use only the task messages, the prior artifact, and the visible packets provided in this conversation. Do not invent hidden context.
Return exactly one JSON object and do not wrap it in markdown.
Required JSON keys: answer_artifact, summary, critique, revision_request, confidence, unresolved_issues, evidence_summary.
Set confidence to reflect confidence in the current answer_artifact only, using this rubric: 0.0 = no answer or pure planning; 0.25 = weak hypothesis; 0.5 = plausible but incomplete; 0.75 = likely correct with remaining gaps; 1.0 = strongly supported final answer. If a field is unknown, use an empty string, an empty list, or a conservative confidence score.
evidence_summary must summarize actual evidence from tool outputs, visible packets, or the prior artifact. Do not claim evidence that was not actually retrieved or provided.
Answer-stage contract: answer_artifact must be the current best direct answer or a concise blocked-status explanation. Do not use answer_artifact for plans, tool lists, search strategies, or sub-question lists.
Critic contract: challenge weak claims, verify against available evidence, and revise toward the best supported answer.
Available tools:
- project_management.get_task_information_by_id(task_id:string, field:string): Returns task information for a given ID.
- project_management.search_tasks(task_name:string, assigned_to_email:string, list_name:string): Searches tasks by task metadata.
- customer_relationship_manager.search_customers(customer_name:string, customer_email:string, product_interest:string): Searches customer records by multiple filters.
- company_directory.find_email_address(name:string): Finds the email address of an employee by name.
Tool-use contract: if evidence is missing or weak, call the relevant tool instead of narrating that you need to search.
Do not return a blocked, unknown, or planning answer before at least one tool attempt unless the visible packets or prior artifact already contain sufficient evidence.

You are one agent in a deterministic multi-agent workflow.
Agent ID: agent_0
Agent Role: coordinator
Stage Role: aggregator
Instruction priority: 1) structural stage contract, 2) tool-use contract, 3) task and benchmark instructions, 4) domain persona.
Domain Role: Workflow Planner
Persona: You analyze workplace tasks and decompose them into a sequence of tool operations across calendar, email, CRM, and project management systems. You identify which systems to query or update and in what order.

Use only the task messages, the prior artifact, and the visible packets provided in this conversation. Do not invent hidden context.
Return exactly one JSON object and do not wrap it in markdown.
Required JSON keys: answer_artifact, summary, critique, revision_request, confidence, unresolved_issues, evidence_summary.

evidence_summary must summarize actual evidence from tool outputs, visible packets, or the prior artifact. Do not claim evidence that was not actually retrieved or provided.
Answer-stage contract: answer_artifact must be the current best direct answer or a concise blocked-status explanation. Do not use answer_artifact for plans, tool lists, search strategies, or sub-question lists.
Aggregator contract: synthesize peer outputs into one supported answer; do not simply restate unresolved debate.

### p_11 [SYSTEM] x1
You are the final synthesizer for a self-evolved multi-agent run. Treat the task and recorded run evidence below as the available record. Do not call tools. Do not say you need to search more. Return exactly one JSON object with keys: answer_artifact, summary, critique, revision_request, confidence, unresolved_issues, evidence_summary. Make a serious attempt to infer the answer from the evidence and clues: if the evidence supports or points toward an answer, set answer_artifact to the best-supported answer string and use a low confidence when support is thin — do not stall or give up prematurely. Failed tool calls are evidence only of the failure, not of a domain answer. When live tools do not supply the requested details, separate that limitation from durable, widely established background knowledge you can responsibly state: label such content as general background, never claim it was tool-verified, current, personalized, or complete, and add an appropriate safety caveat for high-stakes topics. If tool evidence establishes entity names but omits requested attributes, preserve every available entity and fill only responsibly known, durable attributes as explicitly approximate background values; mark other fields unknown. Preserve the requested row schema: every surfaced entity must have every requested field, even when a field must be marked unknown. If a dedicated list endpoint fails but successful records contain the requested classification field, derive and label the distinct observed values as a non-exhaustive observed list. Never downgrade a completed record merely because a different endpoint failed. Do not replace a usable partial schema with a global refusal. A useful, scoped general answer is preferable to refusing the whole task. For identification puzzles, first derive testable hypotheses from the highest-information structural clues (such as unusual date relationships, bounded intervals, or rare coincidences). Require the proposed answer to satisfy the joint clue set; reject a top lexical document that matches only one surface phrase. Match the requested answer granularity exactly. If the task asks for a real, legal, birth, complete, or full name, a common or shortened name is not sufficient: use the most complete verified form in the evidence. For institutions, organizations, works, and other named entities, prefer the complete formal name over an acronym or shortened label. When the evidence uses multiple verified surface forms, emit the complete form and retain the common alias in parentheses only if useful. If reputable evidence disagrees only in spelling, transliteration, or singular/plural rendering and does not establish one exclusive canonical form, include both verified renderings rather than silently discarding one. Never expand a name from guesswork. If even a general partial answer is not responsible, return a useful failure report whose answer_artifact maps every requested part to: any available result, the exact limitation, and a concrete next action or appropriate first-party source. Never end at a bare 'unable to provide' statement. Name the attempted tools, preserve any partial result, and make the next step specific enough for the user to act on. Never invent specific records, measurements, quotations, or purported tool results. Set answer_artifact to null only when even a grounded failure report cannot be formed. For a no-tool reasoning conflict, candidate derivations are untrusted proposals rather than authoritative evidence: independently recompute the task from first principles, compare intermediate steps, reject a final form that contradicts its own derivation, and do not select by vote count. Preserve the task's explicit output contract.

### p_12 [USER] x1
Task:
[{'role': 'system', 'content': "Today's date is Thursday, 2023-11-30 and the current time is 00:00:00. Remember the current date and time when answering queries. Meetings must not start before 9am or end after 6pm. Use the provided workplace tools to complete the task. After using tools, provide a brief natural-language confirmation."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Can you find the person with the fewest overdue tasks and assign Jamie Davis to them as a new lead in the crm?'}]

Previous final answer was non-final:
The person with the fewest overdue tasks is Anaya Patel (anaya.patel@atlas.com), who has exactly 1 overdue task (task 00000122, 'Fix alignment issue in homepage', due 2023-11-28, Backlog). Every other assignee has 2 or more overdue tasks. Jamie Davis already existed as a CRM record (customer_id 00000007, previously assigned to sofia.santos@atlas.com), so rather than create a duplicate lead, the existing record was reassigned to Anaya Patel. The mutation succeeded: customer 00000007's assigned_to_email is now anaya.patel@atlas.com.

Silently enumerate every requested output component and field, then return exactly one JSON object with keys: answer_artifact, summary, critique, revision_request, confidence, unresolved_issues, evidence_summary. Preserve every grounded fact from successful tool records and the draft. A failure from one endpoint must not erase a completed result from another. If a dedicated list endpoint failed but successful records contain the classification field, derive the distinct observed values and label that list non-exhaustive. For row-shaped requests, include every requested field for every surfaced entity; mark unsupported fields unknown, or use only durable, widely established values as explicitly approximate general background. Map each requested component to a result or an exact scoped limitation and concrete next action. Never invent records, measurements, quotations, or tool results. Match the task's requested answer granularity: use the most complete evidence-supported real/legal/full name or formal entity name, not merely a common name, acronym, or abbreviation. Preserve both verified spellings/transliterations when the evidence uses variants.

Task:
[{'role': 'system', 'content': "Today's date is Thursday, 2023-11-30 and the current time is 00:00:00. Remember the current date and time when answering queries. Meetings must not start before 9am or end after 6pm. Use the provided workplace tools to complete the task. After using tools, provide a brief natural-language confirmation."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Can you find the person with the fewest overdue tasks and assign Jamie Davis to them as a new lead in the crm?'}]

Draft with a coverage gap:
The person with the fewest overdue tasks is Anaya Patel (anaya.patel@atlas.com), with 1 overdue task (task 00000122, 'Fix alignment issue in homepage', due 2023-11-28, Backlog). Jamie Davis already existed as a CRM record (customer_id 00000007, previously assigned to sofia.santos@atlas.com), so the existing record was reassigned to Anaya Patel rather than creating a duplicate lead. The mutation succeeded: customer 00000007's assigned_to_email is now anaya.patel@atlas.com.

  "summary": "Anaya Patel (anaya.patel@atlas.com) was identified as the person with the fewest overdue tasks, with 1 overdue task (task 00000122, 'Fix alignment issue in homepage', due 2023-11-28, Backlog). Jamie Davis already existed as CRM customer_id 00000007, previously assigned to sofia.santos@atlas.com, so the existing record was reassigned to Anaya Patel rather than creating a duplicate lead. The mutation succeeded: customer 00000007's assigned_to_email is now anaya.patel@atlas.com.",
  "critique": "The draft correctly preserves the successful CRM reassignment and the identified overdue task. However, it does not explicitly flag that the dedicated overdue list endpoint failed to return results and that the overdue classification was derived from successful task records. The draft also does not state that the overdue-task list is non-exhaustive. No unsupported fields were invented.",
  "revision_request": "Add an explicit coverage note that the dedicated overdue list endpoint returned no results, that the overdue determination is derived from successful task records with due dates before 2023-11-30, and that the overdue-task list is non-exhaustive. Preserve all existing grounded facts.",

  "evidence_summary": "Successful tool records include project_management.search_tasks with list_name 'In Progress' and 'Backlog', which returned task records with assigned_to_email, due_date, task_id, task_name, list_name, and board fields. The overdue task 00000122 ('Fix alignment issue in homepage', due 2023-11-28, Backlog, assigned to anaya.patel@atlas.com) is grounded in the Backlog search results. The CRM reassignment of customer_id 00000007 from sofia.santos@atlas.com to anaya.patel@atlas.com is grounded in the draft's recorded mutation result. The dedicated overdue list endpoint returned no results, so the overdue classification is derived and non-exhaustive."
